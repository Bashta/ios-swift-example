# Moltin Swift Example App
A simple example app that demonstrates how to use the Moltin iOS eCommerce SDK in Swift.

# Getting started
This example app uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies. To get started, clone the project, open a Terminal window in the project's directory (the one containing the Podfile), and run 'pod install'. Then open the .xcworkspace project file and you'll be able to build the app.

If you don't have CocoaPods installed already, you can install it using [this guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3).
